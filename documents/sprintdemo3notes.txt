Jan, Martijn, project team

9:49 - 10:05

We started by Showing the app

-Registration feature
-validates email
-checks registered username
-checks password length

-premade categories are automatically imported

-picture is taken, but still needs to be selected

-location is null, to be implemented

-showing item list, with sorts

-sorting by date added, as well as every field

-incoming requests, currently placeholders

-last sprint was only connectivity

-view specific item details by tapping on it is not yet available 

-images don't show up on items list at the moment

-FIX ONE THING AT A TIME

Scrum:

-we broke things down into smaller tasks, but we overplanned and have a lot of open issues

-at the beginning of a sprint, the work is broken down and put into tasks

-Estimations of hours need to be done at the start of the sprint, not as we work

-Burndown charts NEED to be there


**This sprint demo is marked as insufficient, if next time we have a flawless Jira scrum environment.**

-No single responsibility should be on the shoulders of a single person.
